# AppEngineBlogpost

What to Submit. Before submitting your assignment, you and your
partner will have to join the same Web Blog group within Canvas. (In
Canvas, click on “People” then click on “Groups.”) Once you do this,
either one of you can submit the assignment, and it will be associated
with both of your profiles. You should submit a lab report that explains
how you implemented this lab assignment.

This report should include the following:

• The URL of your app. In addition to embedding the URL in your lab
report, you should also submit it as a comment to your submission
(that just makes it easier for us to grab and test). We’ll test it by
looking at it, examining its available source, and interacting with it
(we’ll sign in, post, subscribe, etc.). At this point you do not need
to submit your source, but we reserve the right to request to inspect
it at a later point. Keep a snapshot.

• A full description of the functionality of your blog with salient
implementation details and screenshots. Don’t go overboard, but
make sure you hit the highlights.

• Any relevant description of the data structure design backing your app.

• If you implemented more features than the required ones, please list
them and describe them concisely in your own words.

• A short (half page) collaboration statement that succinctly describes
how you and your partner divided the work. Be honest. Each 
partner must do a significant amount of work on the assignment.
For each team member, assess strengths and weaknesses. This
assessment is required (if you don’t submit it at all, your grade will
be affected.) This is your opportunity to reflect on where you need
to focus more. For example, the following statement is the kind of
thing we might expect: “Since Alice did all of the work developing
our css, Bob is less prepared to create a css file from scratch.” Or
“Alice should practice more with the Objectify API; Bob ended up
doing most of the work for storing data.” Or “Wow, Alice is
fantastic at this JSP stuff!”

Grading Rubric. The following is the rough point allocation for the
pieces of the assignment. The entire assignment is worth 100 points.

• The basic landing page is structured correctly, satisfies the stated
requirements, displays posts, displays all of the required content of
posts, etc. – 25 points.

• The basic landing page is not ugly and the style is applied to all pages
– 5 points.

• The app gives the ability to access all posts from the beginning of time
– 10 points.

• Login works with the Google Users API – 5 points.

• Posting new blog entries works, from clicking on the New Post link, to
typing the new post, to submitting it – 20 points.

• The subscribe link works and the email comes – 20 points.

• The unsubscribe link works and the emails stop coming – 10 points.

• Implementation of additional features – 5 points.
